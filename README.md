# Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Open up cmd / terminal
3. Navigate to the folder, e.g. `F:\Repositories\Clue`
4. Create the venv: `python -m venv venv`
5. Activate the venv: `./venv/bin/activate` (Linux) or `./venv/Scripts/activate` (Win)
6. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements
7. In the root directory, run `pip install -e .`

Tah-dah, now you can develop code. 
Your IDE should automatically switch to using the venv, or show a prompt to switch to it, do that and it should run well.
PyCharm automatically switches to it, while in VS Code you need to accept it from a prompt.

    And then info and how to install and set it up.
